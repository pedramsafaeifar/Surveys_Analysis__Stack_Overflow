# Surveys_Analysis__Stack_Overflow
 
The dataset presented is derived from a subset of surveys conducted by Stack Overflow to gain insights into their developer community. This project has explored information about the developer community from various angles. We have gained insights into the worldwide representation of developers, their varied backgrounds, and the connection between experience and compensation.

Through the use of various techniques to handle missing data, a more structured dataset has been successfully prepared for these analyses. These strategies empower the restoration of messy data and hold the potential to assist in handling similar datasets in the future.
